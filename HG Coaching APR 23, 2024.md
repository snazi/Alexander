# Things I want to talk about
- I was weirded out by CE not doing anything about my resignation. Its even weirder that they only took now to reply. The thing is, I feel hesitant about moving on it. It has to happen I know that but, I’m just simply scared.
- I’ve been struggling with the fear that all of this is going change. I’ve been trying to get my coach to go for earlier times but, he’s just not adjusting.
- I gave it my best shot at the league, we’re down 0-4 and some of the reasons why we lost was due to different reasons. The problem with the last game was that the guy who was always blaming our teammates, self-destructed. There was no blaming anyone but himself but, he instead blamed the ref, and got himself technicalled and he just quit on us by not going back into the game.
- I still haven’t been doing Japanese
- I want to improve my journal/2nd brain but, when I planned my improvements, thoughts like “do I have the time to do this?” then I end up playing POE.

## Things I’m picking up
- I’m gonna cope with it no matter what
- 33M
- 40M
- How is this fear trying
- I need to understand this fear.
- How unfounded the fear may be.
