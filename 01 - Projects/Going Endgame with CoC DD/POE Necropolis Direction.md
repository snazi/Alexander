# Direction
I’ve got to work on my gear. Let’s go into ENDGAME gearing on the POB. Let’s work on getting the right socket jewels and skills.

## Neck
- [x] buy decently rolled Yoke of suffering
- [x] anoint "Ash, Frost and Storm" (need 1 Sepia, 2 Crimson oils) for now, 
## Gloves
- [x] buy fractured any t1 fire,cold or lighting res 
- [x] then use Screaming essence of envy (chaos resistance) til good mods
- [x] benchcraft any good mod if possible
- [x] Go for the best mod
## Boots
- [x] buy fractured any t1 fire,cold or lighting res
- [x] then use Screaming essence of envy (chaos resistance) til good mods
- [x] benchcraft any good mod if possible
## Belt
- [x] get at least "14% increased cooldown recovery rate" with other good mods (life or resists, you can just benchcraft life or resists also)
## Rings
- [x] buy good elemental resists and good life ones, 
- [x] you can also try to find a good ring with "+3~4% chance to gain power charge on kill" if you want (just need 1)
